Unknown Fix -> XX

------------------------------

FATAL
===========
// Crash due to division by zero when joining a server with the mod.
// Crash when offhand swapping in GUIs.

HIGH
===========
// Some GUIs are not rendering the locked slots properly (Crafting Table).
// Items in GUIs go into locked slots if no space available.
// Items in cursor are behind some locked slots in some GUIs (e.g. Chest).
// When an item is held in cursor and unlocked inventory is full, the item disappears completely.
// Any non hotbar scrolling is not working due to slot cycling override, instead the hotbar scrolls.
// Health modifier is lost in player respawn.

MEDIUM
===========
// Pressing F to swap item in inventory gets de-synced with in-game image.
// Offhand slot is not rendered on hotbar.

LOW
===========
?? There is a minor flicker when shift clicking to full unlocked inventory.
// Picking up items gets the item into empty slot if found first, instead of searching for matching stacks at start.
